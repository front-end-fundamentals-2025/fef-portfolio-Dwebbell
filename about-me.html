    <p class="profile-info"> A little info to get to know about me. I was born in Sweden and have lived there my whole life. I studied game graphics in highschool, and a fun fact is that if I didn't do games I would study vetrenary/animal husbandry. For about a year I also studied photography, traditional art, digital graphics and movie making.</p>
